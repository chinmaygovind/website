# CLAUDE.md

Chinmay Govind's personal website: a small **Flask** server that serves a static
site. The **root (`/`) is a plain landing page**; the old **Wii-menu recreation now
lives at `/wii/`**. `/ttr` redirects to the **Ticket to Ride** app (bundled as a git
submodule); `/ers` redirects to **Egyptian Rat Screw** (the `ers/` subdir - a real-time
multiplayer card game that shares TTR's accounts).

## What this is / how it runs

- `app.py` is the whole server (~60 lines). It serves everything under `site/`
  as static files with **GitHub-Pages-style directory indexes**: a request to
  `/foo/` serves `site/foo/index.html`, and `/foo` 301-redirects to `/foo/` so
  relative links keep working. Path safety via `werkzeug.utils.safe_join`.
- `/` serves the landing page (`site/index.html`); the Wii menu is at `/wii/`
  (`site/wii/index.html`). `/ttr`, `/ers` and `/kot` (each with and without the
  trailing slash) 302-redirect to `TTR_URL` / `ERS_URL` / `KOT_URL` (env; default
  `https://{ttr,ers,kot}.cgovind.com`). A 404 falls back to the `site/404.html`
  Mario game.
- `app.py` also proxies a few APIs the landing page calls same-origin, so no keys
  reach the client: `/api/duolingo-streak`, `/api/spotify/{login,callback,recent,
  top-artists}` (OAuth refresh token in the box `.env`), and `/api/roll/gemini`
  for the `site/games/roll/` game.
- **No build step, no bundler.** Pages are self-contained static HTML with inline
  `<style>`/`<script>`, same as the old GitHub Pages site this was derived from.
- Local: `python app.py` → http://localhost:5002 (`PORT` overrides). Prod:
  gunicorn behind nginx (see `deploy/`), auto-deploys from `main`.

## Layout (`site/` is the web root)

- `site/index.html` is the landing page: white page, big "hey!" left, welcome line
  and contact links across the top, all in the self-hosted xkcd Script font
  (`site/fonts/xkcd-script.woff`, from ipython/xkcd-font). Below it is a **tile
  grid** — `repeat(6, --tile)` × auto rows, so **12 slots** before it wraps to a
  third row (2 columns on <=760px). Currently 9: resume, poker, whales, racing,
  music, settings on the top row, then the three games — ttr, ers, kot — on the
  second. **Keep `settings` last in the top row** (it's a Wii-menu joke), and add
  new games to the second row so the split holds.
- **Adding a tile is one repeating pattern**, all inside `site/index.html` (no
  build step, so everything is inline):
  1. a `--<name>` accent colour in `:root`, then `.modal-<name>` rules for
     `border-color`, `.pane-title` colour, and `.media-img` border;
  2. a `<button class="tile" data-modal="modal-<name>">` with a `.tile-img` whose
     `data-still`/`data-anim` are `assets/icons/<name>.png` / `.gif` — the script
     at the bottom swaps to the gif on hover and preloads it, so **every tile
     needs both files**;
  3. a `.modal` + `.modal-box .modal-<name>` block, left pane = `.pane-title` +
     `.pane-text` (+ `.modal-icon` gif top-right), right pane = `.media` frames
     holding a `.media-img` or a dashed `.placeholder` while art is pending.
  The generic script wires open/close (X, backdrop, Escape) off those classes —
  a new tile needs no JS. Icon sources are GIMP `.xcf` files kept next to the
  exported png/gif in `site/assets/icons/`.
- Two panes are live rather than static: the resume tile's fast facts patch in a
  computed age and the Duolingo streak, and the music tile fills recently-played
  and top-artists from the Spotify proxy, plus a concert carousel driven by
  `site/assets/music/concerts.json` (add a concert by appending to that JSON —
  no code change).
- `site/wii/index.html` is the Wii menu (was `public/wii/index.html`, briefly at
  root). Warning screen fades into a channel grid. The bottom-left gray slot is a
  **Ticket to Ride channel** (`#channel-ttr`) whose click handler navigates to `/ttr`.
  Its `../../images|audio|videos` paths assume it sits at root, so some break at `/wii/`.
- **`site/warning.html` is gone** (deleted in `d0a282b`) but `site/wii/index.html`
  still navigates to `warning.html`, so the Wii menu's "reset" path 404s into the
  Mario game. The `warning.png`/`warning.wav` assets are still there, so restoring
  the page (at `site/wii/warning.html`, since the link is relative) would fix it.
- `site/channels/{mii,music,codebusters}/` - the Wii channel pages. They
  reference shared assets with `../../images|audio|videos/…` (resolves to root).
- `site/home/index.html` - the **projects landing page** (was the site's old `/`).
  Its assets live in `site/home/{images,audio}/` and `Chinmay_Govind_Resume.pdf`.
- `site/{projects,games}/` - standalone project/game pages (astro, ibec, quickcal,
  robot-tour, bridge, flip, klotski, roll), copied unchanged.
- `site/{images,audio,videos}/` - shared media (Wii menu art + channel media).
- `site/404.html`, `favicon.ico`, `robots.txt` at the root.

## Unlinked pages (nothing on the site links to these)

The landing page's tiles only open modals or point off-site (ttr/ers/kot subdomains,
the resume PDF, YouTube, PennToday). **No internal HTML page is linked from `/` at
all**, so every page below is reachable only by typing its URL:

- **Orphaned outright:** `games/flip/` ("Flip - The Game"), `games/klotski/`
  ("Klotski"), `games/roll/` ("3D Ball Roll Game" — note this one has a live
  backend, `/api/roll/gemini`), `wii/`, `channels/mii/`, and the local
  `projects/ibec/` copy (7 leftover template pages: committees, contact, events,
  membership, left-/right-/no-sidebar).
- **Orphaned transitively:** `home/index.html` (the old projects page) has no
  inbound links either, so the things only *it* links to are also unreachable:
  `projects/astro/` (AstroGPT), `projects/quickcal/`, `projects/robot-tour/`,
  `games/bridge/` (Penn Bridge sim, plus the `projects/bridge/` redirect stub),
  `channels/music/` and `channels/codebusters/` (+ its `pattern.html`).
- `site/404.html` (Mario game) is by design only reachable via a bad URL.
- **Two stale links to fix if you re-link things:** `home/index.html:591`'s "Wii
  Channel" tile points at `../`, which was the Wii menu when it lived at `/` but is
  now the landing page — it should be `../wii/`. And the Wii menu itself only
  navigates for the TTR slot; the mii/music/codebusters channel pages are not
  wired to any channel tile.

## Conventions / gotchas

- **Links are relative** and assume `site/`-as-root. When adding pages, keep paths
  relative; the only absolute paths are a couple that already encode the page's
  own location (e.g. astro's `/projects/astro/static/…`) and `site/404.html`'s
  `/home/audio/…` (absolute so the 404 game works at any URL).
- This site was lifted from `chinmaygovind.github.io/public`. The Wii menu briefly
  sat at `/` but now lives at `/wii/`; `/` is a simple landing page and the older
  projects page stayed at `/home/`. Dead Create-React-App refs (`%PUBLIC_URL%`,
  `logo192.png`, `manifest.json`) were removed.
- **TTR is never reverse-proxied** - its templates hardcode root-absolute paths
  (`/lobbies`, `/login`, `/static/…`) and connect Socket.IO at root, so it can
  only run at a host's root. `/ttr` just redirects to it. Change the target via
  `TTR_URL`, not by mounting TTR under a path.
- `ttr/` is a **submodule**; edit TTR in its own repo, then bump the pointer here.

## Egyptian Rat Screw (`ers/`)

**Live at `https://ers.cgovind.com`** (TLS via certbot). A second real-time game in the
`ers/` subdir (NOT a submodule) that **shares TTR's accounts**. Flask + Flask-SocketIO,
its own eventlet gunicorn `-w 1` on `127.0.0.1:5003` (single worker required: socket rooms
+ game state live in-process), its own venv (`ers/venv`) and `.env` (both gitignored,
hand-created on the box). The engine is server-authoritative; the first valid slap under a
per-game lock wins.

- **Shared accounts:** `ers/.env` sets `DATABASE_URL` to the SAME SQLite file the live TTR
  uses and reuses TTR's `SECRET_KEY` + `SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN=.cgovind.com`, so one login
  works on both sites. `users` is the shared account table; ERS creates `ers_stats` /
  `ers_games` / `ers_players` / `ers_slaps` in that same file (WAL + busy_timeout for
  concurrent access). ERS's `User` model maps only the account columns.
- **Prod DB path gotcha:** the live TTR does NOT run from this repo's `ttr/` submodule; it
  runs from a **separate clone `/home/ubuntu/TicketToRide`** (systemd `tickettoride`, port
  5001), whose db is `/home/ubuntu/TicketToRide/instance/tickettoride.db` -- that is the
  shared file `ers/.env`'s `DATABASE_URL` points at.
- **SSO is one-directional in prod:** a login on ERS carries into TTR (ERS sets a
  `.cgovind.com` cookie signed with the shared key), but TTR -> ERS auto-login is NOT wired
  because the live TTR clone still sets a host-only cookie. Same credentials work either way.
- **The `ttr_stats` refactor is NOT deployed.** This repo's `ttr/` submodule has edits that
  move TTR stats out of `users` into `ttr_stats` (+ cookie-domain SSO), but the running TTR
  is the separate clone, so in prod **TTR still uses the `users.elo` columns** and ERS uses
  `ers_stats`; both coexist in the one db. Deploying that refactor means committing it in the
  `github.com/chinmaygovind/TicketToRide` repo and `git pull` + restart on
  `/home/ubuntu/TicketToRide` (back up the db first).
- **Layout:** `ers/app.py` (auth + lobby routes ported from TTR, socket game loop, bots,
  ELO/stats finalize, ping, spectators, kick/leave), `ers/game_logic.py` (pure, unit-tested
  rules engine -- `cd ers && venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/`), `ers/models.py` (shared
  `User` + `ErsStats`/`ErsGame`/`ErsPlayer`/`ErsSlap`), `ers/templates/` + `ers/static/`
  (wooden oval table, xkcd Script font, gold, pyramid PWA icons, synth `flip.wav`/`slap.wav`).
- **Rules:** royalty tribute (A/K/Q/J owe 4/3/2/1); slaps = double, sandwich, top-matches-
  bottom, add-to-ten, King+Queen; a wrong slap burns 1 card + a 2s freeze; **one life** to
  slap back in after running out; last player holding all 52 wins. Bots (`is_bot` ErsPlayer
  rows) slap with `max(0.5s, Exponential(mean 2s))`, driven by eventlet timers.
- **Feel:** everyone is a seat (dot + count + name) around the table, your flip pile
  down-left and SLAP down-right of your seat; a card flies from a seat and flips into the
  pile in one motion; a colored hand smacks on every slap (red X on a wrong one); cards
  slide to whoever wins the pile; a wrong slap lifts the pile to slide the burned card
  under face-up; scrollable fading chat; live ping; spectators can watch playing games.
- **Full game history:** every game's move-by-move replay is in `ers_games.events_json`;
  each slap is also a row in `ers_slaps` (with `reaction_ms`) -- e.g. a reaction-time
  distribution is `SELECT reaction_ms FROM ers_slaps WHERE valid=1 AND reaction_ms IS NOT NULL`.

**ERS deploy:** pushes to `main` run the usual Action, which now also (when `ers/.env`
exists on the box) builds/updates `ers/venv` from `ers/requirements.txt` and
`sudo systemctl restart ers`. nginx has an `ers.cgovind.com` vhost (`sites-available/ers`,
proxy to `:5003` with WebSocket upgrade) with its own Let's Encrypt cert; Route 53 has the
`ers.cgovind.com` A record. `/ers` on the main site 302-redirects there (`ERS_URL`). nginx,
TLS, DNS and `ers/.env` are all hand-managed on the box (not shipped by the Action), same as
the rest of the deploy. See the `prod-infra` memory for the full box layout.

## King of Tokyo (`kot/`)

**Live at `https://kot.cgovind.com`.** The third game, same shape as ERS: Flask +
Flask-SocketIO, its own eventlet gunicorn `-w 1` on `127.0.0.1:5004`, its own venv
(`kot/venv`) and `.env` (both gitignored, hand-made on the box), sharing TTR's `users`
table for accounts. Stats live in `kot_stats`, games in `kot_games` / `kot_players`.

- **Layout:** `kot/game_logic.py` (pure rules engine), `kot/cards.py` (all 66 power
  cards), `kot/bot.py` (the bot brain, also pure), `kot/app.py` (auth, lobby, socket
  game loop, bot orchestration, ELO), `kot/models.py`, `kot/templates/` + `kot/static/`.
- **Tests:** `cd kot && venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/` - `test_engine.py` covers the
  rules, `test_bot.py` covers the bot (liveness, legality, latency, strength).
- **A log line's `kind` is what makes the sound.** `LOG_SOUND` in `static/js/game.js`
  maps kinds to stings, and the same `kind` becomes the `.log-<kind>` CSS class, so
  the engine controls audio purely by how it labels a log line - which means adding
  or renaming a kind silently changes what the client plays. Kinds are `vp`, `energy`,
  `heal`, `attack`, `ko`, `buy`, `revive`, `win`, `sys`, `tokyo` and `tokyo_take`.
  **Only `tokyo_take` (actually moving in) is loud**; holding Tokyo, yielding it and
  being shoved out are `tokyo`, which shares the purple log styling but has no sound.
  `test_only_taking_tokyo_is_loud` pins that split; a separate test asserts every
  damaging/scoring one-shot card logs at least one loud kind.

### Bots

The host adds bots from the lobby ("+ Add bot"), same as ERS/TTR. They are ordinary
`KotPlayer` rows with `is_bot=True` and no `user_id`, so they take a monster and colour
like anyone else and are excluded from ELO. Names are drawn from `BOT_NAMES`
(Bot-zilla, Claw-de, Mechatron, The Terminator, Gloopy); **Bot-zilla gets 50% of the
weight on the first bot added**, the others split the rest.

- `bot.py` is pure decision-making - it never touches Flask, the DB or the clock.
  The dice choice is a memoized expectimax over the remaining rerolls, scoring every
  reachable tray with a context-aware utility. Everything else (yield, buys, hearts,
  Psychic Probe) is a policy in the same VP-equivalent units.
- **All strategic weights live in `bot.W`**, tuned by self-play. Re-run the sweep if
  you change one; `test_bot.py` has strength thresholds that will catch a regression.
- **Latency matters more than it looks.** One eventlet worker serves every live game,
  so a slow decision blocks *all* players' sockets, not just the bot's table. The
  search caches its reroll transition tables globally to stay ~3ms; a naive version
  measured 523ms. `test_dice_decision_is_fast` guards this.
- **Bots must always answer.** The engine parks the entire game in `yield`,
  `probe_window` or `token_choice` until the monster on the clock decides. Every bot
  step in `app.py` runs atomically under the game lock and is written to guarantee
  forward progress - the scheduler will not arm the same `(kind, seq)` twice, so an
  action the engine silently rejects would freeze the table. This is why the buy phase
  is one step ending in `end_turn`, and why `_bot_probe` always drains the queue.
- `_bot_kick(code)` is the single scheduler; it takes the per-game lock, so **never
  call it while holding that lock** (eventlet semaphores are not reentrant). Every
  state-mutating path ends by calling it.

### Replays

`kot_games.events_json` is the move-by-move replay: one entry per action (`roll`,
`resolve`, `yield`, `token_choice`, `buy`, `sweep`, `card_action`, `end_turn`,
`resign`, plus `start`/`end`), each with the choice made, a snapshot of every
monster's hp/vp/energy/cards, Tokyo occupancy, and the engine log lines that action
produced. Bot moves carry `"bot": true`. Note this only became true recently - games
before that have `start` and `end` and nothing in between, so any analysis has to skip
them.

## Drive (`drive/`)

**Live at `https://drive.cgovind.com`.** The fourth game, same shape as ERS/KoT:
Flask + Flask-SocketIO, its own eventlet gunicorn `-w 1` on `127.0.0.1:5005`, its own
venv (`drive/venv`) and `.env` (both gitignored, hand-made on the box), sharing TTR's
`users` table for accounts. A PolyTrack-style low-poly driving game: nine
point-to-point time-trial tracks, medal times, ghosts, and multiplayer rooms.

- **Guests can play.** Driving alone needs no account at all (`/` and `/solo/<slug>`
  are open); sharing a room needs only a name (`/guest`). Times only reach the
  leaderboard when logged in - guests keep a PB in `localStorage`.
- **Layout:** `tuning.py` (every physics constant, in one place), `tracks.py` (the
  block format + the pool, authored with a turtle `Builder`), `laptime.py` (racing-line
  relaxation + speed profile → medal times), `runcheck.py` (ghost packing, time
  validation), `models.py`, `app.py`, `static/js/` (`trackmesh.js`, `physics.js`,
  `course.js`, `render.js`, `sound.js`, `game.js`, vendored `three.module.js`).
- **`tuning.py` is the single source of truth for the simulation.** It is embedded in
  the play page as `window.DRIVE_TUNING` and read by the JS physics, and `laptime.py`
  uses the same numbers to derive medal times. There is deliberately no second copy of
  `ACCEL` in a .js file. Retuning the car retunes the medals.
- **The collision surface IS the render surface.** `trackmesh.js` puts every driveable
  triangle into both the mesh and a spatial hash, so ramps, banks, loops and bridges
  all work through one closest-point query with no per-block special cases - and
  nothing can look solid without being solid.
- **Steering rotates the car about the surface normal, not world up**, which is the
  whole reason a full loop needs no special case in the car code. Gravity is always
  applied and its normal component removed while grounded, so slope acceleration falls
  out for free.
- **A "ramp" holds you down, a "jump" launches you.** The suspension (`SNAP`/`SUSP`)
  keeps the wheels on a ramp crest; a kicker launches you because past its lip there
  is no road within probe range. The launch comes from geometry, not a special case.
- Tracks that float in the void (`ground: None`) are built with `rails=True`; tracks on
  the ground are not, so running wide there costs grass time instead of a respawn.
- **Live races are in memory, not the DB.** A race ticks 20x/sec: clients are
  authoritative over their own car and emit `pose`, the server merges and fans out one
  snapshot per tick, and only the finished standings are written back. Cars are solid,
  resolved Mario-Kart-style (impulse + penetration spring, never positional snapping,
  tangential velocity preserved, per-pair bump cooldown) - see `Car.resolveCars`.

### Tests

`cd drive && venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/` - 139 tests. `test_tracks.py` and
`test_runcheck.py` are pure Python. **`test_sim.py` runs the game's real JavaScript
headlessly**: `tests/jsrt.py` strips the ES module syntax, swaps three.js for
`tests/three_stub.js` (real Vector3/Quaternion maths, inert graphics), and runs it in
QuickJS, then `tests/autopilot.js` *drives every track to the finish*. That is the test
that matters - it caught road and grass being coplanar (the car thought it was on grass
for whole laps), every ramp crest launching the car, double-sided wall collision
geometry cancelling velocity twice per step, loops folding back tightly enough to trap a
car forever, checkpoint planes being tracked across the whole map so real passes went
unnoticed, and four tracks that could not be finished. Needs the optional `quickjs`
package; those tests skip without it, so a plain deploy install is unaffected.

**Drive deploy:** the usual Action also (when `drive/.env` exists) builds/updates
`drive/venv` and `sudo systemctl restart drive`. nginx has a `drive.cgovind.com` vhost
proxying `:5005` with WebSocket upgrade, its own Let's Encrypt cert, and a Route 53 A
record. `/drive` on the main site 302-redirects there (`DRIVE_URL`). As with the others,
nginx/TLS/DNS/`.env` are hand-managed on the box.

## Deploy

Prod is one Ubuntu EC2 box at the Elastic IP `54.157.20.148`, serving
`cgovind.com`/`www` (the website) and `ttr.cgovind.com` (TTR) over HTTPS through
nginx + certbot (Let's Encrypt, auto-renew). Route 53 hosts the `cgovind.com`
zone. The website runs as the `website` systemd service (gunicorn on
`127.0.0.1:5002`); TTR runs as its own service on `127.0.0.1:5001`.

Push to `main` triggers `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: an import check, then an
SSH deploy (repo secrets `EC2_HOST`/`EC2_USER`/`EC2_SSH_KEY`, where `EC2_HOST` is
the Elastic IP) that runs `git reset --hard origin/main`, `git submodule update`,
`pip install -r requirements.txt`, and `sudo systemctl restart website`. That is
all it does: it ships `site/` and `app.py` but does NOT touch nginx, TLS, or the
box `.env`, and does NOT run `deploy/setup.sh`. Apply nginx/TLS/`.env` changes by
hand over SSH (`ssh ubuntu@54.157.20.148`; nginx config at
`/etc/nginx/sites-available/website`). `deploy/setup.sh` is the one-time bring-up.

Say "push" (or run `/push`) to commit, push, watch the Action, and verify the
live site in one go. If the SSH step fails with `dial tcp :22 i/o timeout`, the
`EC2_HOST` secret is stale: `gh secret set EC2_HOST --body 54.157.20.148`.
