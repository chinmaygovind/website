"""Who is here, and who has been here - the one copy, shared by five services.

Two tables, both in the database every service already shares:

* ``site_visits`` is the log: one row per request that was a *visit* rather
  than a piece of furniture, across cgovind.com and all four games. It is the
  only place in the application that has ever recorded an IP address; before
  this, answering "who is this account" meant reading nginx's logs and matching
  timestamps by hand against the database, which works and does not scale past
  the fourteen days nginx keeps.
* ``user_presence`` is one row per account: where they are and when they were
  last seen. It is what the green dot on a profile reads.

**This file is copied verbatim into each service** (``drive/visits.py``,
``ers/``, ``kot/`` and TTR's own repo), which is this repo's convention for
things five separately-deployed processes all need - the same reason each owns
a copy of ``User``. ``tests/test_no_drift.py`` asserts the copies are
byte-identical, so the duplication cannot rot: there is nothing to keep in step
by hand, only a file to copy. That is also why nothing here imports a model or
a service-specific name. It is handed the ``db`` it should use and reads
``flask.session`` for the columns it needs, so the text of the file has no idea
which service it is running in.

Three rules it must never break, since it runs on *every* request:

1. **It cannot fail a request.** Every entry point is wrapped, and a database
   that is missing, locked or unmigrated costs a log line and nothing else.
2. **It cannot be slow.** One INSERT, and an UPSERT at most every
   ``PRESENCE_EVERY`` seconds per person. Session stitching reads from an
   in-process cache and only falls back to a query when that misses.
3. **It never stores text somebody else chose.** A status line is drawn on a
   public page, so the detail is looked up from a whitelist by the caller and
   what arrives from a browser is a key, never a sentence. See ``seen``.
